# ANYO: Multilingual Penmanship

[My Notes](notes.md)

This website is simply meant to supplement the user's second language acquisition with writing practice in their target script for learning to write individual letters/characters and simple words. Ideally, this website is used on mobile devices with touchscreen capabilities (and thus would honestly be better suited as an app).

However, this website can also expand to include practice for different forms of writing within a single language, such as Pitman shorthand, Deseret, or cursive for English.

>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Writing is a huge language learning, especially when it comes to practicing comprehension and high-level thought expression, but its underdeveloped in mobile language learning platforms. This mobile website aims to supplement language learners with opportunities to properly learn and practice writing letters/characters and common words in their target language according to its unique practices, so that students' second language acquisition becomes more balanced and aligned culturally.

### Design

![Three Webpage Parts Sketches](Web_Startup_Sketch.jpg)

This sketch contains a login screen, a homepage screen (with hints at a separate friends tab for the leaderboard), and an exercise screen within a lesson.
